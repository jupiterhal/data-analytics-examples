\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This spreadsheet underwent several key data cleaning steps to prepare it for analysis. First, filters were applied to columns A to H to identify and delete any rows containing blank cells. Each column was filtered individually using the "Is empty" condition, and blank rows were deleted, including any residual empty rows. Next, the dataset was transposed from a long format (more rows than columns) to a wide format (more columns than rows) by copying the data and using the "Paste Special \uc0\u8594  Transposed" feature starting at cell I1. The original long-format columns A to H were then deleted. After transposition, all extra white spaces in cell values were removed using the "Trim whitespace" function in Google Sheets or the TRIM formula in Excel. String data was cleaned by converting text to a uniform case, specifically upper case, using the ChangeCase add-on in Google Sheets or formulas in Excel. Lastly, all formatting was cleared from the dataset using the "Clear Formatting" option to ensure a clean, uniform dataset.}
