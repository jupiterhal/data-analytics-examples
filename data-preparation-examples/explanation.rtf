\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This dataset ( obtained from Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course on coursera) was cleaned to prepare for analysis of factors influencing student performance. The data was first sorted by the school column in ascending order (A\'96Z), then by the age column in descending order (Z\'96A) to organize students by school and age. Invalid age entries (20\'9622) were removed, as the valid range for public high school students is 15\'9619. Missing values in the reason column were filled with the placeholder none_given to ensure completeness. Additionally, text values in the Medu and Fedu columns, representing the education levels of the mother and father, were converted to numeric codes ranging from 0 to 4 to support further statistical analysis.}
